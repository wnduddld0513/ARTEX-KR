# API Recon (frontend API reconnaissance)

Under the premise of **authorized** access, discover as completely as possible: **backend APIs** (paths, methods, parameters, response bodies), **frontend routes**, and **UI feature trigger points** (tabs, modals, table actions, etc.).

---

## Boundaries and Prohibitions (Agent must read · violating these is out of bounds)

This skill **does API / parameter surface reconnaissance only**; it is not the vulnerability-hunting or penetration-exploitation phase.

### Task boundaries

| Scope | Allowed | Prohibited |
|---|---|---|
| **Target** | Enumerate paths, methods, parameters, routes, UI trigger points | SQLi/XSS/authorization bypass/brute force/fuzzing vulnerabilities, packet-tampering attacks, destructive operations |
| **Auth** | Hook + stub/mock to bypass the **client-side** login gate | Asking the user for credentials or guessing them; attempting real login form submissions |
| **Runtime** | Hook APIs without credentials and use mock responses to bring the SPA into the post-login shell | Flows that require a real backend session to continue |

### Credential-free dynamic analysis (Phase 3 default)

1. Use `preload.js` / `runtime_harvest.js` to **intercept and stub** bootstrap APIs such as login, permissions and menus;
2. Return mock bodies that are **structurally correct, with a successful business code and optionally empty data** for business query APIs;
3. Make the frontend render post-login pages even with no backend or in a 401 environment, thereby triggering more XHR/fetch/WebSocket traffic;
4. **Empty data, blank tables and placeholder UI are all expected** — do not switch to real login or vulnerability testing because of them.

**In one sentence**: use mocks to hold the frontend routes and component mounting open, and **record outbound requests only**; what the backend returns does not matter — what matters is **which further APIs the frontend sends**.

### Process Hard Prohibitions

| Prohibited | Instead do |
|---|---|
| grep/curl/Read the main entry `index-*.js` to extract API paths before Phase 1 completes | Run `OUTDIR/harvest_static.py` |
| Hand-write scripts such as `extract_apis.py` that replace harvest | Edit `OUTDIR/harvest_static.py` and re-run it |
| Repeating the same grep/command after it has failed ≥2 times | Change strategy: read tool_logs, modify harvest, check reference |
| Skipping gate A/B and running the original `scripts/` directly | Copy into OUTDIR and modify for the target |
| Real usernames/passwords, OTP, OAuth, etc. for authentication | stub/mock (see above) |
| Skipping stubs "to get real data" and doing authorization-bypass/injection tests | Record outbound only; that is the recon boundary |
| Irreversible operations such as deleting, exporting sensitive data or bulk writes | The same applies to coverage clicks |
| Claiming all pages and APIs were obtained without finishing runtime + dynamic enumeration | See "Definition of Done" or note the limitations |
| Claiming all parameters are known without finishing the parameter trigger matrix + diff | Phase 3b matrix + Phase 5 diff |
| Inferring required/optional from a single runtime sample | Multi-sample diff, or reverse-inference from validation rules/errors |

---

## The Two-Layer Model + Run Modes

| Layer | Output | Limits |
|---|---|---|
| **Static** (JS bundle) | Full endpoint paths, route draft, candidate fields at packet-assembly sites | No HTTP methods; parameters need Phase 1b; misses runtime-concatenated URLs |
| **Runtime** (live session) | Method + body + response + dynamic URLs + WS/SSE; multi-sample diff completes parameters | Pages must actually render before requests are sent; a single sample cannot settle required/optional |

| Run mode | Engine | Suitable for |
|---|---|---|
| **depth** | `runtime_harvest.js` (Puppeteer) | API inventory, METHOD/params/response bodies, WS/SSE, reproducible batch runs |
| **coverage** | browser + `preload.js` | Click tabs/modals/tables; deeper feature-point coverage |
| **both** | depth first, then coverage | Most complete, slowest |

**Parameter methodology** (no general-purpose script): use harvest/regex for paths; for parameters use **anchor window expansion + UI binding chain + multi-sample diff + error reverse-inference** (grep recipes in section J of [reference.md](reference.md)).

---

## Definition of Done

recon may only be claimed complete when all of the following hold:

- [ ] **Static**: Phase 1 harvest produced `api_static.txt`, `routes.txt`, `js/`
- [ ] **Runtime**: at least one of depth or coverage; coverage/both require **Hook effective + dynamic enumeration loop**
- [ ] **In the shell**: accessing a business path does not land on `/login` (mind hash routing)
- [ ] **Parameters**: coverage/both completed the parameter trigger matrix + `param_samples.json`; Phase 5 merged `params_merged.json`
- [ ] **Depth** (when module pages are blank): Phase 4 recovered the permission tree and re-ran until **module-level APIs** appear (not just locale/bootstrap)
- [ ] **Delivery**: Phase 5 outputs are complete (see the Phase 5 output table); `insert_assets` wrote service and endpoint assets

---

## Scripts and Gates

`scripts/` are reference templates only; running the originals directly and treating them as the final result is **prohibited**.

**Rules**: read first → modify for the target → write into `OUTDIR` (e.g. `recon/`) → record in `CHANGES.md`; if it does not fit, rewrite it following the methodology and borrow only the structure.

| Gate | When | Reference script → OUTDIR copy | Common mandatory edits |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A (static)** | After Phase 0, before the **first** harvest/spider run | `harvest_static.py` / `spider_mpa.py` | **Most sites can run the default regex as-is**; edit the endpoint regex, webpack/Vite `publicPath` or MPA exclude/cookie only when the manifest/dialect does not match |
| **B (runtime)** | After Phase 2, before running depth/coverage | `runtime_harvest.js` / `preload.js` + `config.json` | Cookie/localStorage keys, neutralize success values, stubs, login regex, api prefix, hash/history |

**Mandatory SPA order** (not interchangeable; phase numbers take precedence over "explore first, script later"):

| Step | Required | Prohibited |
|---|---|---|
| After Phase 0 completes | The next Bash command = `python3 OUTDIR/harvest_static.py <URL> OUTDIR` | curl/grep/Read the main entry `index-*.js` (usually >500KB) |
| Gate A | Copy the script → make small edits as needed → **run it immediately** | Manually extracting APIs first and deciding whether to harvest afterwards |
| Before Phase 1 completes | Verify the output with `wc -l`; on 404 edit harvest and retry | Hand-writing extract scripts; repeatedly grepping URLs that were never downloaded |
| From Phase 1b on | grep only `OUTDIR/js/*.js` | Using the main bundle in place of harvest |

- ✅ Copy `harvest_static.py` → (optionally) edit the regex → **run immediately**
- ❌ curl the main bundle → grep several times → write a temporary extract → harvest last
- **MPA**: after Phase 0, the next Bash command = `python3 OUTDIR/spider_mpa.py ...`

---

## Tool and Output Constraints

| Constraint | Description |
|---|---|
| Large files | Reading/grepping `index-*.js` larger than 100KB into context is **prohibited**; batch-process with an OUTDIR script |
| grep output | Always `\| head -20` or `-m 5`; keep only path summaries in the conversation and never paste bundle fragments |
| Verification | Use `wc -l`, `ls \| wc -l`; do not Read an entire directory |
| Initial regex probing | Optional, ≤1 time, only small chunks ≤50KB or HTML; the official static result is harvest |
| reference | See [reference.md](reference.md) for recipes/templates/troubleshooting; do not inline the whole thing again |

---

## Execution Roadmap

```
Phase 0 classify + OUTDIR
  → Gate A → Phase 1 harvest (★ run immediately ★)
  → Phase 1b parameter reversing
  → Phase 2 the three auth gates → config.json
  → Gate B → Phase 3 runtime + parameter matrix
  → Phase 4 permission tree (if needed) → re-run Phase 3
  → Phase 5 merge report + insert_assets bulk-insert every discovered service and endpoint api asset; under no circumstances may discovered assets be omitted during insertion
```

Check the boxes in order; **do not move to the next Phase until the previous item is complete**.

1. [ ] **Phase 0**: probe SPA/MPA; create `OUTDIR` → [Phase 0](#phase-0--classification)
2. [ ] **Gate A + Phase 1**: copy the script → harvest **immediately** → verify with `wc -l` → [Phase 1](#phase-1--static)
3. [ ] **Phase 1b**: anchor window expansion + binding layer → `param_candidates.json` → [Phase 1b](#phase-1b--parameter-reversing)
4. [ ] **Phase 2**: the three auth gates → `config.json` → [Phase 2](#phase-2--the-three-auth-gates)
5. [ ] **Gate B**: adjust the runtime script → [Phase 3](#phase-3--runtime)
6. [ ] **Phase 3**: depth / coverage / both; confirm you are in the shell; parameter trigger matrix → `param_samples.json`
7. [ ] **Phase 4** (if needed): permission tree → patch stubs → re-run Phase 3 → [Phase 4](#phase-4--permission-tree-recovery)
8. [ ] **Phase 5**: merge outputs + report + `insert_assets` → [Phase 5](#phase-5--merge-and-report)

---

## Phase 0 — Classification

Fetch the entry HTML and **create `OUTDIR`** (do not modify the skill's own `scripts/`):

- **SPA**: empty shell + `<div id=app>` + chunk → Phase 1–5
- **MPA**: SSR + `<form>`, no endpoint bundle → after Gate A:

```bash
python3 recon/spider_mpa.py <BASE_URL> <OUTDIR> [--cookie "session=..."] [--max 300] [--depth 5] [--exclude "logout|delete|destroy"]
```

Outputs `forms.txt`, `links.txt`, `api_inline.txt`. For an SPA, if forms ≈ 0 → switch to Phase 1.

---

## Phase 1 — Static

Follow [Scripts and Gates](#scripts-and-gates) and [Tool and Output Constraints](#tool-and-output-constraints).

```bash
python3 recon/harvest_static.py <BASE_URL> <OUTDIR>
```

harvest: parse HTML scripts → webpack/Vite manifest → download all lazy chunks → produce `js/`, `api_static.txt`, `routes.txt`, `chunkmap.txt`.

```bash
wc -l OUTDIR/api_static.txt OUTDIR/routes.txt
ls OUTDIR/js | wc -l
```

- chunk count vs manifest: on 404, edit harvest and retry; do not curl chunks one by one by hand
- `api_static.txt` too small → relax the endpoint regex inside OUTDIR and re-run (see reference)

### Phase 1b — Parameter Reversing

Paths come from Phase 1; parameter fields must be recon'd separately. Grep rules: see [Tool and Output Constraints](#tool-and-output-constraints).

**Completion criteria**: for important APIs you can answer — field name, transport location, inferred type, whether it is required, sample values, confidence.

#### 1b.0 — Transport shapes

| Shape | Where the parameters are | What to look at statically |
|---|---|---|
| REST JSON | body + query | `(params\|data\|body)\s*:\s*\{` next to the path anchor |
| GraphQL | `variables` | gql templates, `$page: Int` |
| Classic form | urlencoded | `<form>`, `FormData` |
| File upload | multipart | `FormData.append` |
| Path parameters | `/user/:id` | route table + `useParams` / `$route.params` |
| Encrypted/signed | wrapped in `sign`/`data` | Hook the encryption function's arguments (reference section D) |

Output: annotate each API with `transport: query|json|form|graphql|encrypted`.

#### 1b.1 — Anchor window expansion

Use a known path as an anchor and expand the window to find the packet-assembly object:

```bash
grep -n '"/api/user/list"' OUTDIR/js/*.js | head -20
grep -rhoaE '.{0,120}("/api[^"]+").{0,200}' OUTDIR/js/*.js | head -20
grep -rhoaE '(params|data|body|payload)\s*:\s*\{' OUTDIR/js/*.js | head -20
```

| Wrapper layer | Parameter clues |
|---|---|
| axios instance | `data` / `params` |
| Unified request | the interceptor injects global fields |
| OpenAPI client | generated method signatures |
| React Query / SWR | the hook's second argument |
| Vue composable | composable arguments |

Type leftovers: `yup`/`zod`/rules, `Form.Item name=`, embedded Swagger.

→ `param_candidates.json`: `{ path, fields[], source: "static-callsite", confidence }`

#### 1b.2 — Binding layer

```
Form field → onFinish/handleSubmit → transform → API payload
```

| Binding source | Technique |
|---|---|
| Form submit | follow submit → transform → API |
| Table search | `getFieldsValue()` → `params` |
| Routing | `:id` / `?tab=` |
| Interceptors | global `tenantId`, paging, sign |
| Enum select | `options` → API enum values |

In the DevTools call stack, walk up from `fetch`/`XHR.send` to the packet-assembly function.

#### 1b.3 — The three packet-construction questions (≠ the three Phase 2 auth gates)

| Question | What to answer |
|---|---|
| **Assembly** | where the payload is built, transform traces |
| **Validation** | required, pattern, enum |
| **Transport** | path / query / body / multipart / headers |

The interceptor gate (Phase 2) also reads globally injected fields (Authorization, `X-Tenant-Id`, sign).

#### 1b.4 — Handoff to Phase 3

Candidate fields come from the static/binding layer; **required/optional/conditional dependencies** must be settled with the Phase 3 parameter matrix + diff + Phase 5 error reverse-inference.

---

## Phase 2 — The Three Auth Gates

grep inside `OUTDIR/js/` (with `head`) and write `config.json` (recipes: see reference):

| Gate | Question | Keywords |
|---|---|---|
| **Render gate** | How is "logged in" determined? | `isLogin`, `getToken`, Cookie/localStorage |
| **Interceptor gate** | What triggers a jump to `/login`? | `response_code`, `errno`, axios interceptor |
| **Content gate** | Where do menus/permissions come from? | `menu`, `permission`, `role`, `acl`, `routes` |

Do not treat localStorage key names as credentials — confirm them from the chunk/request chain.

**Exit = Gate B**: put the conclusions into `config.json` and edit `OUTDIR/runtime_harvest.js` / `preload.js`.

### Phase 2b — API Observation (optional)

Use `preload.js` in OUTDIR to confirm session key names, Authorization and nested API URLs:

| Config | Output |
|---|---|
| `recordDetail: true` | `__API_RECON_DETAIL__` |
| `observe.xhrHeaders: true` | header observation |
| `extractUrlsFromResponse: true` | child APIs inside responses |
| `observe.storageReads/cookieReads: true` | back-fill config |
| `neutralizeVueRouter: true` | `__API_RECON_ROUTES__` |

coverage exports each round: `__API_RECON_LOG__`, `__API_RECON_DETAIL__`, `__API_RECON_ROUTES__`, `__API_RECON_OBSERVE__`.

---

## Phase 3 — Runtime

Gate B must already be passed; follow [Boundaries and Prohibitions](#boundaries-and-prohibitions-agent-must-read--violating-these-is-out-of-bounds) and the credential-free mock strategy.

Set `"runtimeMode": "depth" | "coverage" | "both"` in `config.json` (see reference for the template).

### Hook and stub (shared by depth + coverage)

| Layer | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| L1 precise | auth/permission/bootstrap stubs | get past first-screen auth |
| L2 negative correction | all JSON responses | not-logged-in code → success |
| L3 fallback | `/api` etc. not matched by L1 | empty success body to hold the UI open |

- **depth**: fake auth + `forward` to rewrite business codes + `stubs`; iterate `routes` (hash/history); produce `runtime_api.json`
- **coverage**: inject `preload.js` at **document-start** (CDP `addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` or a Userscript)

Verify: `window.__API_RECON_PRELOAD__` exists; business paths do not bounce back to `/login`.

```bash
cd recon && npm install
node runtime_harvest.js config.json
```

### 3b — coverage dynamic enumeration (required)

1. Main navigation/sidebar — click every item and wait 1–3s for network
2. Tabs — `role=tab`, `.ant-tabs-tab`
3. Tables — first-row view/edit/details
4. Toolbar — export, filter, create new (**avoid irreversible deletes**)
5. On entering each module — merge APIs/routes
6. SPA — controlled `pushState` for paths not covered by `routes.txt` (prohibited for MPA)

**Parameter trigger matrix** (required): record each module once per action type and **diff the multiple samples**:

| Action | Parameters usually added |
|---|---|
| First list screen | paging + default filters |
| Click search | keyword, filter |
| Advanced filter | more optional fields |
| Create/edit | full entity |
| Bulk/export/sort | `ids[]`, `exportType`, `sortField` |

**Under stubs, outbound body/headers are still real** — trust the request. Record → `scan_raw.json`, `param_samples.json`, `api_detail.json`.

- **Vue**: `neutralizeVueRouter: true` + document-start preload
- **React**: `routes.txt` + sidebar clicks + `pushState`
- **both**: 3a depth first, then 3b coverage

---

## Phase 4 — Permission Tree Recovery

**Trigger**: module pages blank / every route only returns bootstrap (e.g. locale) → the content gate did not pass.

| Symptom | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Shell entered successfully | render gate + interceptor gate passed |
| Sidebar entries missing/blank on click | stub shape or permission codes incomplete |
| Every route has the same, very few APIs | `v-if permission` not passing |
| `routes.txt` far smaller than the bundle | needs completion from the auth module |

```bash
grep -rhoaE '"/api[^"]*(permission|perm|role|menu|acl)[^"]*"' OUTDIR/js/*.js | sort -u | head -30
grep -rhoaE 'userRouteAuth|getResultTree|routeMap|routeLink|menuList|authList' OUTDIR/js/*.js | head -20
```

Typical chain: `role_permissions` (flat codes) + `permissions/all` (tree) → `getResultTree` → `userRouteAuth[CODE].url`.

```bash
python3 recon/extract_route_map.py recon/js recon/
python3 recon/build_perm_tree.py recon/js recon/ --config recon/config.json
```

Intermediate outputs: `route_map.json`, `userRouteAuth.json`, `permissions_tree.json`, `*_stub.json`, `perm_codes_all.txt`.

Stub checks: the outer `response_code` matches the interceptor gate; flat codes align with the tree; `routes` covers every link in `route_map`.

After updating `config.json`, **re-run Phase 3**. For large SPAs you can tune `waitUntil`, `routeTimeout` and `perRouteMs` (see reference sections A3/I).

---

## Phase 5 — Merge and Report

### Output table

| File | Stage | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `js/`, `api_static.txt`, `routes.txt`, `chunkmap.txt` | 1 | static bundles and paths |
| `param_candidates.json` | 1b | static parameter field candidates |
| `config.json` | 2 | the three gates + runtime config |
| `runtime_api.json` | 3a | depth detailed recording (incl. WS/SSE) |
| `param_samples.json`, `scan_raw.json`, `api_detail.json` | 3b | multiple samples, click log, detail |
| `route_map.json` etc. | 4 | permission tree intermediate files (if executed) |
| `params_merged.json` | 5 | merged parameter fields + confidence |
| `api_merged.txt` | 5 | `METHOD /path [params] [static\|runtime\|both]` |
| `site_map.json` | 5 | routes, APIs, params, feature points, limitations |
| **insert_assets** | 5 | write every service and endpoint asset into the asset library |

### 5b — Parameter merge

Diff from `param_samples.json`; **there is no general-purpose merge script**. Confidence rules: see reference J7 (high/medium/low/pending-trigger).

### 5c — Error reverse-inference

Within the authorized scope you may send incomplete requests to read 400s (**this is parameter recon, not vulnerability testing**): `field 'x' is required`, enum errors, etc. Mind the `data` wrapper, `variables`, and encrypted `bizData`.

The report must state: runtimeMode, static/runtime API counts, parameter confidence, uncovered modules, and a `CHANGES.md` summary relative to the reference scripts.

Recommended `site_map.json` structure:

```json
{
  "site": "https://example.com",
  "runtimeMode": "both",
  "appType": "vue-spa",
  "routeGuardStrategy": ["nav-neutralize", "L1-auth", "L2-patch", "forward"],
  "apisFromStatic": [],
  "apisFromRuntime": [],
  "apis": [],
  "params": [{ "method": "POST", "path": "/api/user/list", "transport": "json", "fields": [] }],
  "frontendRoutes": [],
  "routesVerifiedByClick": [],
  "featuresTriggered": [],
  "limitations": ""
}
```

More fields and grep recipes: see [reference.md](reference.md).

## General Notes

- **Framework-agnostic**: webpack/Vite/Angular lazy loading works the same way
- **Transports**: REST/JSON, GraphQL, WebSocket, SSE; gRPC-web is out of scope
- **SSR**: client-side fetch can be recorded; RSC/Server Actions cannot be fully enumerated
- **Blind spots**: JSVMP, WASM, strong HMAC/mTLS verification → static + note the limitations
- **Parameter blind spots**: conditional coupling, hidden params, WASM packet assembly → "pending trigger"/"unreachable"
- **Static is the safety net**: when runtime is blocked, static can still enumerate endpoints
